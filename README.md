This repository contains three C# console applications that simulate different aspects of a hero's journey through various challenges. Each project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as classes, functions, conditionals, loops, and decision structures. These applications were built using **.NET 8.0** to explore hero-based adventures.

## üì¶ Projects

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Hero XP Level Classifier**

In this challenge, a hero's experience points (XP) determine their rank. Based on the amount of XP, the hero is classified into different levels ranging from **Ferro** to **Radiante**.

#### üìù How It Works:

- The program asks for the hero's name and their total XP.
- Depending on the XP provided, the hero is ranked in one of the following categories:
  - **XP < 1,000**: Ferro
  - **1,001 <= XP <= 2,000**: Bronze
  - **2,001 <= XP <= 5,000**: Prata
  - **5,001 <= XP <= 7,000**: Ouro
  - **7,001 <= XP <= 8,000**: Platina
  - **8,001 <= XP <= 9,000**: Ascendente
  - **9,001 <= XP <= 10,000**: Imortal
  - **XP >= 10,001**: Radiante

#### üíª Example:

```
Digite o nome do her√≥i:
Arthur
Digite a quantidade de XP do her√≥i:
5500
O Her√≥i de nome Arthur est√° no n√≠vel de Ouro.
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Ranked Match Calculator**

In this challenge, the hero's win/loss record is used to calculate their performance rank in ranked matches. The program calculates the hero's net victories (wins - losses) and determines their performance level based on their total wins.

üìù How It Works:
The program asks for the total number of wins and losses.
Based on the total wins, the hero is ranked in one of the following levels:
Wins < 10: Ferro
11 <= Wins <= 20: Bronze
21 <= Wins <= 50: Prata
51 <= Wins <= 80: Ouro
81 <= Wins <= 90: Diamante
91 <= Wins <= 100: Lend√°rio
Wins >= 101: Imortal

```
Digite a quantidade de vit√≥rias:
45
Digite a quantidade de derrotas:
20
O Her√≥i tem um saldo de 25 e est√° no n√≠vel de Prata.
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Hero Class with Attack Function**

In this challenge, a generic Hero class is created, allowing a hero to have properties like name, age, and type. The hero can then perform an attack, and the attack message varies based on the hero's type (e.g., Warrior, Mage, Monk, Ninja).

üìù How It Works:
The program creates a Hero object with the following properties:
Name
Age
Type: Either "mago", "guerreiro", "monge", or "ninja"
The Atacar method displays a different attack message depending on the hero's type:
mago: uses "magia"
guerreiro: uses "espada"
monge: uses "artes marciais"
ninja: uses "shuriken"

```
Digite o nome do her√≥i:
Zane
Digite a idade do her√≥i:
30
Digite o tipo do her√≥i (mago, guerreiro, monge, ninja):
ninja
O ninja atacou usando shuriken.
```
